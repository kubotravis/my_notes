### 2 Fun with IPv4 Basics

#### Questions
  1. How many periods (dots) are in the dotted decimal IPv4 address ?
  2. What are the two parts of IPv4 address
  3. What determines the  dividing the  line between the two parts of an IPv4 address ?
  4. How do you see the current IPv4 address you are using it right now ?

#### Answer
3. MASK does(determines) the divide.
  ```
  ex:
  ip: 192.168.1.5
  mask: 255.255.255.0
  ```
so the first 3 bit are belongs to NEWORK & rest goes for HOST

   - Detailed explanation will be there later section
   - This guy says only function of MASK to divide the network/host bits from Actual ip - new stuff

**Other Note**
   - Getting Dynamic IP - this thing is done by "Dynamic Host Protocol"

### 3 Classes, Masks and Private IPs

#### Questions
1. What the class of `191.192.127.99` ?
2. What is the default mask of the `175.32.66.123` ?
3. What is the range for Class B private address ?
4. Is it really matter knowing the class of IP ?

#### Answers
4. Because of Default mask (sort of identifier) - which tells (or controls) that IP address going front and back
  - for Class A, the very first bit is NW bit since the default Mask is `255.0.0.0`
  - for Class B, the first two bit is NW bit since the default Mask is `255.255.0.0`
  - for Class A, the first three bit is NW bit since the default Mask is `255.255.255.0`

#### IP Range of Class
  - Class A (1-126)
  - Class B (128-191)
  - Class C (192-223)

- `127` belongs to no class (Basically goes to localhost), Its reserved for loopback interface

How to find out the Netwirk address in case of any class of IPv4 address ? ip is `192.34.56.67`

Answer:
Since its Class C IPv4. so first three bit goes for NW bit & rest goes for HOST
Ip `192.34.56.0` -> `0` is the starting of the HOST IP here, So this is Network IP
it must belongs to any of network devices (like Router/Switch)

Commonly used IPv4 Private Address

```
Class A: 10.x.x.x
Class B: 172.16-31.x.x
Class C: 192.168.x.x
```

What is the Purpose of the Private Address ?

Imagine any company setup network with `8.x.x.x` & some of other device got the IP from it.
When ever you make query to Google public DNS `8.8.8.8`, it will NEVER match or get response.
Because the PC thinks it local & it never go for DEFAULT GATEWAY to resolve the `8.8.8.8`
So in-order to avoid such collision we had to have the PRIVATE IPs as listed above.

### 4 Beautiful Binary

#### Questions:
1. What is the binary values of 4th position (right to left) ?
2. Are there only 10 types of people regarding binary ?
3. How many place holders do we need to be concerned with ?

#### Answers:
1. 8
2. Gotcha - this is Binary joke
3. I didn't get the question at all !

**Notes**
Base10 Numbering  ->  Decimal
here numbering system goes like below, (from left to right)

```
ex:
45,1234 ->
... 10000  <- 1000 <- 100 <- 10 <- 1
```

Base2 numbering - 1 & 0 -> Binary
here numbering system goes like below, (from left to right)

```
... 128 <- 64 <- 32 <- 16 <- 8 <- 4 <- 2 <- 1
```

### 5 Decimal to Binary Conversion

#### Questions:
1. What is the Decimal equivalent of 01011010 ?
2. What is the binary equivalent of 130 ?
3. What is the binary equivalent of 255 ?

#### Answer:
Simple, do it yourself !

**Notes**
Octet = group of 8 bits
8bits = 1 Byte

#### "Does it fit" game

If you want convert any number into binary, write down the below

`128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1`  & ask that number does it fit in ?

 ex: take a number 130 
  - It will fit in in 128 & take reminder 2 & 2 only will fit in 2.
  - Now mark as 1 which ever FIT in & make rest as 0
  - This is how you will be the Decimal to Binary conversion
 so,
 
 ```
 130 -> 10000010
 193 -> 11000001
 17 -> 00010001
 95 -> 01011111
 136 -> 10001000
```

#### Binary to Decimal conversion
- This is reverse of the above function
- Get the binary number & map it as below

```
 1      0     1     1    1    0    0    0
128 <- 64 <- 32 <- 16 <- 8 <- 4 <- 2 <- 1
```

Add numbers which  got all ONEs

so above binary becomes,
`10111000 - 184`

### 6 The Mask Unveiled

#### Questions:
1. PC has the IPv4 15.69.35.28 with the mask of 255.255.0.0
   What is the network this computer is connected to ?
2. How many bits from the IP are being used to represent the "network" ?
3. What is the significance of a bit being "on" in a mask ?
4. Do the Mask bits, going from left to right, have to be "on" in a order ?
5. What is the purpose of Mask ?

**Notes:**
Purpose Mask: Actually it identifies IPv4 address as which portion is part of "network" & which part is "Host"

  - IP - 32 bits of address
  - Mask - 32 bits of address

Mask/Network Mask/Subnet Mask - all are same simply naming convention differs

How they are saying its 24 bit network (something like this 192.168.1.0/24)

Ex:

The IPv4 is    : `192.168.1.15`
and its Binary for each decimal:   `11000000 10101000 00000001 00001111`

Mask is : `255.255.255.0`
Binary: `11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000`

If you subtract the IPv4 binary with Mask you get the follow

```
IPv4 11000000 10101000 00000001 00001111
Mask 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
----------------------------------------
     11000000 10101000 00000001 00000000   -> 192.168.1.0
```
   - Since each deciam has 8bits so 3*8=24, since last bit considered as HOST so you cant include it for calculating the netwowrk
     (Almost 3 decimal same as IP). so it becomes 192.168.1.0/24

 - Here is the another question
  ```
  Ip : 192.168.1.15
  Mask: 255.255.0.0
  ```
  
- Now what is the NetworkIp or network address ?
  Its gonna be : `192.168.0.0` 
  ( Possibly from given mask first 2 field goes for Network & 2 for HOST, so it becomes `192.168.0.0/16`)

- One more question
```
 Ip : 192.168.1.15
 Mask: 255.0.0.0
```
  - Now what is the Network IP or network address ?
    Its gonna be : `192.0.0.0` ( Possibly from given mask first 3 field goes for Network bit & 1 for HOST, so it becomes `192.0.0.0/8`)
