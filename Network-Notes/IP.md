Opt Questions ( if you know the answers then you skip this video)
  1. How many periods (dots) are in the dotted decimal IPv4 address ?
  2. What are the two parts of IPv4 address
  3. What determines the  dividing the  line between the two parts of an IPv4 address ?
  4. How do you see the current IPv4 address you are using it right now ?

#### Answer
3. MASK does(determines) the divide.
  ex:
  ip: 192.168.1.5
  mask: 255.255.255.0
so the first 3 bit are belongs to NEWORK & rest goes for HOST

 - Detailed explanation will be there later section
 - This guy says only function of MASK to divide the network/host bits from Actual ip - new stuff

**Other Note**
   - Getting Dynamic IP - this thing is done by "Dynamic Host Protocol"
