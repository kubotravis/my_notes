Python Basics
---
Minimal Info can found here.

**Intro**
Get it from internet or some where.

**Note**
Be alert on INDENTATION

**Basic Math**

```python
>>> print 1 + 1  # This is the reason its called loosely type
2
>>> print 1 * 3 (Mul)
>>> print 4 / 2 (Divide)
>>> print 2**16 (Exponentional - 2 Power 16)
>>> print 10 - 5 (Sub)
```

**Strings**
(Double quotes)
```python
>>> print "Hello World"
Hello World  # Since python is loosely coupled, so yo no need to specify the new line character (\n) but still it prints the new line
>>> print "Hello World\n"    # Here it prints extra new line

>>>
```

(Single quote) - Python interpreter is pretty smart to handle here
```python
>>> print 'Hello\nWorld'   # It doesn't print the "\n" at all, it evaluates instead.
Hello
World
```

(Help - stuff)
```python
>>> help() # Gives the help information
help> keywords
help> module spam # Searching the documentation for the module
help> quit  # Exit out from the help interpreter
```

**Variables**

```python
>>> print 200 / 4 * 5
160
```

```python
name = "Python"   # This how assigns VAR/VALUE combination
```

 - You don't required any `"$"` like in perl to define the variable value
 - "=" is the assignment operator here
 - We have used String so we have to keep it under `""` much like in all other programming language

**Data Types**

- String, Int, Float, Lists, Tuples, Dictionary
- Python interpreter was pretty smart to understand what is the variable type which is available in the script, will cover more in the type() later
- Dictionary are like Hash in Perl/Ruby (Key/value pairs)
- Tuples & Lists are like arrays
- Int, String, Float are just types of variables

- Just like any other language variable names are case sensitive

```python
>>> name = "Python"
>>> print name
Python
>>> type(name)         # As you can see, Python interpreter was smart
<type 'str'>
```

- If something variable quoted in "", its considered as STRING, refer the below

```python
>>> Price = 666
>>> price = "555"
>>> print price, Price
555 666
>>> type(Price)
<type 'int'>
>>> type (price)      # Since price value ("555") mentioned under double quotes ("") so it become string
<type 'str'>

>>> price = 365.00    # Here it goes for FLOAT
>>> type(price)
<type 'float'>
```

Another useful build function is `id()` - which is useful to get the memory location where the values currently stored in

```python
>>> price = 365.00
>>> id(price)
140653874971696
```

Also when you refer the already store values, it doesn't create the new it simply refers the previous one (Kind of alias)

```python
>>> newprice = price
>>> id(newprice)
140653874971696
```

Also note that, if you update existing variable also it update to NEW location

```python
>>> id(val)
140653874966912
>>> val = 23445
>>> id(val)
140653874997720
```
**Basic Math**

- Python follow standard operation
- Just like all other programming language, python also its own order evaluation

```
(PEMDAS)
 P - Parenthesis
 E - Exponential
 M - Multiple
 D - Division
 A - Addition
 S - Subtraction
```
  - Above are the order python evaluates in the math operation
  - But there are some things, Since D&M considered as same priority it will interchange in case D comes first while evaluating
  Same applies for A & S

examples

```python
>>> print 2**8 * 4 / 4 + 44 - 44  # Normal order
256
>>> print 100 / 2 * 3   # This one doesn't follow as mentioned in the case #2 (since D & M same line but D comes first)
150

```
- In python in case INT divide operation doesn't return FLOAT, it will return the values in INT only, refer the below

```python
>>> print 100 / 6
16
>>> print 100 / 6.0
16.6666666667
```

PARENTHESIS - here is the example

```python
>>> print 100 / 2 * 3
150
>>> print 100 / (2 * 3)
16
```

Modulo - Calculating the reminder in the division

```python
>>> print 100 / 16
6
>>> print 100 % 16
4
```

We can put the above in the single line

```python
>>> print "100 divided 16 is :", 100 / 16, "An the reminder is:", 100 % 16
100 divided 16 is : 6 An the reminder is: 4
```

**STDIN input**

String Concatenation

```python
>>> print "First", "Second"
First Second
>>> print "First" + "Second"    # This is the example of string concatenation, simple "+" will do
FirstSecond
>>> print "First "*3            # Another example (simply use space in string itself to get rid of ugly format)
First First First
```

Some more examples

```python
>>> print "First\n"*3
First
First
First

>>> print "First\t"*3
First First First
```

**How to collect the input from the user ?**
- By using the "input" & "raw_input" built in functions
    - "input" will be used get the INT data type
    - "raw_input" for string & all others as well

```python
>>> message = raw_input("Wassup? ")                 # Just storing the input values from user in "message"
Wassup? Hi There
>>> print message
Hi There

>>> my_num = input("Please enter any INT: ")       # Just storing the input values from user in "my_num"
Please enter any INT: 6
>>> print my_num
6
```

If you tried insert the "String" under "input" function it will return error, refer the below

```python
>>> my_num = input("Please enter any INT: ")
Please enter any INT: one million
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<string>", line 1
    one million
              ^
SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
```

Sample script

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
# Purpose: Hello World
# Author: Me
# Date : 31-12-2017

name = raw_input("Yo, Whats your name? ")
age = input("BTW, Dude what is your age? ")
exp = input("Well, How long you gonna live? ")
org = exp - age

print "Dear", name, "As per our calculation, you are gonna live only,", org, "more years !"
print "Have FUN !!!!!"

#END
```

**Strings I**

- Calculating the string with len()

```python
>>> import string
>>> msg="Hello"
>>> len(msg)
5
```

- Extracting specific string from given word, the very first character noted as "0"

```python
>>> print msg[0]
H
```
- Some other examples
`msg="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"`

For the below, very first character noted as "0

- `print msg[:]` - return the entire string (just same as "print msg")

- `print msg[:2]` - Print only very first two (0,1) character (boundary value never gets printed)
`'ab'`

- `print msg[2:10]` - Print from 2rd to 9 character only & don't print the rest
`'cdefghij'`

- `print msg[2::10]` - print the from the 2rd value + every 5th occurences of it
`'cmw'`

**Strings II**

In order to use the string related operation you have use the following once after the shebang shell `import string`

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import string

name="yo yo"

print len(name) # This is doesn't required the "import string"
print string.upper(name)
print string.lower(name)

print string.capwords(name)   # Cap's the every first char of word
print string.capitalize(name)  # very first char of whole sentence

print string.split(name)  # Here delimiter considered as " " since name delimited by the same

```

**String III**

Write the script from above - String II
(Include "for" looping the each character in the string)

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import string

name="yo yo"
print "The Length of the name is: ", len(name)
print "Convert to Upper: ", string.upper(name)
print "Convert to back to Lower: ", string.lower(name)

print "CAP the very each 1st word only: ", string.capwords(name)
print "CAP the very 1st word: ", string.capitalize(name)

print "Split the name: ", string.split(name)

print "Loop the Name: "
for i in name:
  print i

Name="yo yo"

if name == Name:
  print "They Match"

print "Join the Name: ", string.join(name)
```

**Note**
Interactive Shell doesn't required the "print" to return value but script EXPLICITLY required the "print" return the values

**Lists I**
- Which is used to allow store in the "String,int, whatever" values in comma separated list & gives access to them
- List should declared inside the `[]` with `","` separated values
- anything quoted within `""` are considered as strings

Functions which is available over the List
- `listname.reverse()` - reverse the content
- `listname.append()` - appends to list with new list in the element place (Refer the below code result)
- Basically above makes the nested list
- `listname.pop()` Removes the last # It considers the list as stack & perform LIFO method
- listname.extend()` - this is Extends the listname with new list
- listname.insert()` - inset the element into the specific index value, refer the below code

```
ex:
    listname.insert(index-position, value)
    listname.insert(0,1)
```

**NOTE**
FIFO = used in the queue mechanism, especially in Mailing system

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import string

numlist=[1,2,3,4,5]
print "Print the Numlist", numlist

numlist.reverse()
print "Reverse it: ", numlist

numlist.reverse()
print "Back to Normal", numlist

numlist2=[6,7,8,9]
# Below does the append (not the extend)
# Appending the numlist2 into numlist1 in last element place
# Does the nested list
numlist.append(numlist2)
print "1St element" ,numlist[0]
print "3rd element", numlist[2]

print "6th element", numlist[5] # It prints full list which nested
print "1th from 6th element", numlist[5][0] # It prints only the 1st element from numlist[5]
print "4th from 6th element", numlist[5][3]

# Delete the last
numlist.pop()
print "After POP", numlist

numlist.extend(numlist2)
print "After extent: ", numlist

numlist.pop()
print "Removing again last item from numlist: ", numlist

# Remoce the very 1st element from the numlist
numlist.pop(0)
print "After removing 1st element by pop: ", numlist

# INserting the values
numlist.insert(0, 1)
print "After Insert: ", numlist
```

**List II**

- `range(10)` => print 0-9 in list format
- `range(1, 10)` => prints from 1 to 9
- `range(1,10,2)` => prints incremental of 2, from 1 through 10, such as below

```python
>>> range(10)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>> range(1, 10)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>> range(1,10,2)
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```

Lets move string based LIST

 - string list needs to be inside the double quotes `""`
 - Almost all functions are same which ever we evaluated in the `INTEGER` based list as above

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

# Simply printing some INT by range
print range(10)
print range(1,10)
print range(1,10,2)

stringlist = ["My", "String", "list", "is", "HERE", "Okay"]

print stringlist

stringlist.reverse()
print "Lets Reverse it", stringlist

stringlist.reverse()
print "Revert the stringlist back to normal, ", stringlist

strlist2 = ["This", "is", "Another", "string", "list"]
print "Lets print string list2: ", strlist2

stringlist.append(strlist2)
print "After Append: ", stringlist

print "1st Elmement: ", stringlist[0]
print "3rd Element: ", stringlist[2]
print "7th Element", stringlist[6]

print "1st of 7th Element: ", stringlist[6][0]

print "Pop the last element from stringlist, ", stringlist.pop()

stringlist.pop(0)

print "After Removing the 1st element: ", stringlist

stringlist.insert(0, "myNew")

print "After insert: ", stringlist
```

**List III**

- Gonna dealing with the String manipulation, by processing the logfile
- `logfile[0:3]` - prints 0th, 1st & 2nd index element not the 3rd one: refer below code

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import string

logfile = "20170122 1.1.1.1 9000 2.2.2.2 8880 300 test.go"

print "The logfile content: ", logfile

logfile2 = string.split(logfile)

print "The logfile2 is: ", logfile2

print "logfile is: ", type(logfile)
print "logfile2 is: ", type(logfile2)

print "1st element in logfile2", logfile2[0]

print "Only 0st to 2nd", logfile2[0:3]

print "1st to 5th", logfile2[1:6]

print "Form the new LIst from the above output"
logfile3 = logfile2[1:6]

print "Here we go, logfile3: ", logfile3
print "Bring the logfile3 bck to string", string.join(logfile3)

# now it prints as the list, because in previous we didn't save it ! just converted and printed
print logfile3
```

**List IV**

Writes the script for the above (We already did it)

**Dictionaries**

Intro:

- list as mutable => means can change at any time by using the string operation
- Tuple => Are immutable, we cant change once it declared | In other words its readonly

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

distro = ["Centos", "RHEL", "SuSe", "Debian", "Ubuntu", "Arch", "Manjaro"]

print distro
print type(distro)

# Instead deleting the Changin the values

distro[2] = "OpenSuse"
print distro

# So above operation applicable only in List, Not possible in Tuples
# Lets do that also

# This is how you have declare the Tuples by using () parenthesis
distro2 = ("Rpi", "Elementary", "Solus", "Xbmc")
print distro2
print type(distro2)

# When you trying to change the you get an error
# like blow
# distro2[2] = "Fedora"

# We append, prepend to it, but we can change # Serious I'm not sure i have to check
```

That's all abut the Tuples

**Jumping into Dictionary**
- Basically its a BULK in number of Key-Value pair
- Also its an un-ordered list / If you want list, then you have to use SORT function but it by default print in KEY in alphabetical order

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

mydict = {'Year': 2017, 'Month': 1, 'Date': 22}

print mydict
print type(mydict)

# How to extract anyof those
print "getting the Year: ", mydict['Year']
print "getting the Month: ",mydict['Month']
print "getting the Date: ",mydict['Date']

# Adding the new KV
mydict['Time'] = 13.00
print "After adding time: ", mydict

# Changing the values
mydict['Time'] = 13.35
print "After changing the time: ", mydict

print "Printing all the Keys: ", mydict.keys()
print "Printing all the Values: ", mydict.values()

# Deleting the KV pair
del mydict['Time']
print "After deleting the TIME: ", mydict

# Iterate them
# Iteritem in build python capability
for k,v in mydict.iteritems():
  print k, v

# Multiple values for single Key
# Basiaclly 1-to-Many Relationship

values = [1, 2, 3, 4]

mydict['nums'] = values

print "With Multiple Values Dict: ", mydict

# Iterate them again
for k,v in mydict.iteritems():
  print k, v
```

**Conditional I**

Conditional Operations/Operator
- `<` less than
- `<=` less than or equal to
- `>` (Greater than)
- `>=` (Greater than equal)
- `==`  (Equals to)
- `!=` or `<>`  (Not Equal to)

***Note:*** I just came to know about declaring the var/values in the same line

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

# This is declaring the 2 var is same line

min, max = 8, 9

print "Min", min
print "Max", max

# If condition, condition is true it gonna print
if min < max:
  print min,"Min is < Max", max

# The condition is NOT true nothing gonna print here !
if min > max:
  print min,"Min is > Max", max

if min == max:
  print "Min eq to Max"
else:
  print "Its not Equal"

if min <= max:
  print "Min less than Max"

if min >= max:
  print "Min is greater than Max"
else:
  print "Max is Max"

if min <> max:
  print "They are NOT equal"
else:
  print "They are equal"
```

**Conditional II & Conditional III**

- Command line arguments were stored in the `sys` module, so if want to play around arguments you have to import the "sys" module
- Basically its stores into `sys.argv`, basically its a list. It will store all the cmdline arguments which you are passed
- `sys.argv` 1st element is the name of the script (just like BASH)
- Get the length of by using `len(sys.argv)`, it includes the script name also in the count (actually the very 1st one)
- `elif` are considered as the `nested if`
- `else` does use any condition parameter, its used to by-pass the all conditions

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

import sys

print "Simply print the SYS.ARGV", sys.argv
# Run script pass some are
# ex: ./basic_cond2.py arg1 arg2 arg3
# Results: Simply print the SYS.ARGV ['./basic_cond2.py', 'arg1', 'arg2', 'arg3']

passed = len(sys.argv)-1
print "Length of the ARGS: ", passed

my_len = 2

if passed == 0:
  print "You are SICK, enter something"
# Simple condition I
#else:
#  print "You got it Bruh !"
elif passed == my_len:
  print "Its Equal!"
elif passed < my_len:
  print "You are insane"
elif passed > my_len and passed <= 10:
  print "Its under 10"
elif passed >= 11:
  print "U r awesome"
```

**For Loops**

- Does the iteration of each of the values from any type of the data

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import string

name="HellYeah"

print "Looping the Name Char"
for var in name:
  print var

list = range(1,10)
print "Looping the Nums"
for j in list:
  print j

stringlist = ["This", "is", "String", "list"]
print "Looping the Stringlist"
for k in stringlist:
  print k

# Some weird example, i don't that im gonna use it!
logfile = ["2017 1.1.1.1 3333", "2017 2.2.2.2 4444"]
logfile2 = []

for i in logfile:
  logfile2.extend(string.split(i))
  print logfile2
```

**While Loops I & While Loop II**

- Unless the "Condition" becomes TRUE it performs the block of the code
- So the condition is become "TRUE" then it stops the block & control over to the next

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

count = 0
print "Gonna Perform WHILE"
while count <= 5:
  print count
  count = count + 1

print "WHILE is ended"

# Below writing the Infinite loop
# while 1:
#   print "Infinite loop"

# Some dump code to check while

my_num = 9

guess_num = input("Guess the number: ")

while my_num != guess_num:
  guess_num = input("Guess the number: ")
```

Another example

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import sys

my_num = 9
count = 0

guess_num = 100 - my_num

while my_num != guess_num:
  guess_num = input("Guess the number: ")

  if count == 3:
    print "Would you like to exit the Program? (yes/no): "
    user_pref = raw_input()
    if user_pref == "yes":
      sys.exit()
    else:
      count = 0
  count = count + 1
```

***Note:*** From the above first it will ask for "4" times, but when you say "no" to exit, it will only asks "3" times. This scenario will be explained later

**File I/O I**

- In python if you open a file, the file handlers gonna run IN-MEMORY
- Just any other language its does all things with python

- Modes that are available
  `r` - read
  `rb` - read binary
  `w` - write
  `wb` - write binary
  `r+` - read and write

- below code, doesn't have try/error handling mechanism
- Check the document page, basically each mode has its own may function

- Ex: 
  - `r` - has `readline()` - Where used to read the line by line (in a string)
  - `readline()` returns the very first line ("first char" to breaking of the line "\n") & stored in string
  - `read()` reads entire file stored as one string
  - `read(12)` only reads the till 1st to 12 character in the file (count start from 1 not zero)
  - `readlines()` its is literal, its prints out everything (including the line breaks)

***Learned:**
- If readline() & read() are in the same script, which left by readline() returned in the read() function.
i.e if file has 10 line, 1 st line goes by readline(), and the read 9 lines returned by read( )

- Same goes for every other method, how to avoid ? - before using any other read method you should close the file

***Note:***
read() - bit dangerous if your file is very large, chances it may exhaust your memory

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

# Opening a file in READ mode
handler1 = open("myfile.txt", "r")

# Just prints the file descriptor/handler information
print handler1

# Or even you can assign into variable
#print handler1.readline()

firstline = handler1.readline()
print type(firstline)
print firstline

# Reading the entire file
whole_content = handler1.read()
print type(whole_content)
print whole_content

# Reading the specific line
print "Reading the 3rd line only"
spec_line = handler1.read(3)
print "3rd line: ", spec_line


# Using the readlines()
everything = handler1.readlines()
print "Here we are printing everything by using the readlines()", everything
```

**File I/O II**

- Here we will be using 2 handlers for both "Read" & "Write" operation
- Just came to know Write line function doesn't insert the NEW line ("\n"). Yes, its so if you are copying any content to an another file it gonna be same as original
- when ever do any operation on the file you have to "CLOSE", if its missed sometimes changes wont take effect
- Reading from one file & writing it to another files then use readlines(), cuz we required trailing new lines to print it as a original so the combination is readlines() & writelines()

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

# Here file names can be variablized, if you require
hand1 = open("data1", "r")
hand2 = open("data2", "w")

val1 = hand1.readlines()

#for i in val1:
#  hand2.write(i)

# Avoid the loop to write the content
# It takes care of the looping the content
hand2.writelines(val1)

# Close the file handlers
hand1.close()
hand2.close()
```

**File I/O III**
Here we are going to prompt the user to enter the files name/location - Nothing fancy

- some "append" based operation
  - `a` Append mode - incase the target file is not available then it creates, If its available just does the append

If you run the blow multiple time you can see that "data3" file would have been grown by append operation like by concatinations

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

hand1 = open("data1", "r")
hand2 = open("data3", "a")

val1 = hand1.readlines()
hand2.writelines(val1)

hand1.close()
hand2.close()
```

- Working with "r+" (aka Read and Write)

  - If you var/val to APPEND/write there wont be any newline char
  - If you readlines() there is proper "Trailing" new line character

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

# Reading and Writing it to the same file

hand1 = open("rdwrite.txt", "r+")

val1 = hand1.readlines()
print val1

#val2 = "Yo Yo"
val2 = hand1.readlines()

hand1.writelines(val2)

hand1.close()
```

**File I/O IV**

- Basically content handled in FILE I/O was `String`, Especially in `write()` operation
- So variable has integer values `(val = 3)` & you are trying to write it into another file by using `write()` it will fail.
- Because write consider the input as `STRING`, but we actually passed the `INT`
- Also it consider it has a `Tuple`, so Tuples are immutable

- Refer the below code, if you tries execute it will fail !

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
hand1 = ("rdwrite.txt", "w")

myvar = 34
mystr = "String"
myint = 56

hand1.write(mystr,myvar,myint)

hand1.close()
```

- So in-order to fix the above code we have to use the `Formatter` by adding the `%`
  - Types of formatter
    - `%s` - string
    - `%d` - integer
    - `%f` - float

So refer the below code fixed code

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
hand1 = ("rdwrite.txt", "w")

mystr = "String"
myvar = 34
myint = 56

hand1.write("%s %d %d" % (mystr,myvar,myint))

hand1.close()
```

- Above fixcode is not working in mycase (with python 2.7)

- Another sample code to increent and store it

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
hand1 = ("rdwrite.txt", "w")

myvar = 34
mystr = "String"
myint = 56

while myint < 100:
  hand1.write("%s %d %d" % (mystr,myvar,myint))
  myvar = myvar + 1
  myint = myint + 1

hand1.close()
```

- Another example with FLOAT (print only 2more num after the dot)

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
hand1 = ("rdwrite.txt", "w")

myvar = 34.50
mystr = "String"
myint = 56

while myint <= 100:
# %2f say that print only 2 digit after the dot (like 33.20, not 33.234334)
  hand1.write("%s %.2f %d" % (mystr,myvar,myint))
  myvar = myvar + 1
  myint = myint + 1

hand1.close()
```
