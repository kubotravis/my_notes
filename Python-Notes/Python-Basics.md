Python Basics
---
Minimal Info can found here.

**Intro**
Get it from internet or some where.

**Note**
Be alert on INDENTATION

**Basic Math**

```python
>>> print 1 + 1  # This is the reason its called loosely type
2
>>> print 1 * 3 (Mul)
>>> print 4 / 2 (Divide)
>>> print 2**16 (Exponentiona - 2Power16)
>>> print 10 - 5 (Sub)
```

**Strings**
(Double quotes)
```python
>>> print "Hello World"
Hello World  # Since python is loosely coupled, so yo no need to specify the new line character (\n) but still it prints the new line
>>> print "Hello World\n"    # Here it prints extra new line

>>>
```

(Single quote) - Python interpreter is pretty smart to handle here
```python
>>> print 'Hello\nWorld'   # It doesn't print the "\n" at all, it evaluates instead.
Hello
World
```

(Help - stuff)
```python
>>> help() # Gives the help information
help> keywords
help> module spam # Searching the documentation for the module
help> quit  # Exit out from the help interpreter
```
