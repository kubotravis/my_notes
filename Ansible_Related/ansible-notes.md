### 1. Architecture & Process flow

**Control server**

(Ansible) ------> Target server

Requirements: (Ansible-Control server)
- Python 2.6+
- Platform Unix/Linux NOT Win32

Target servers:
- \*nix
- Python (simpleJSON library) + SSH
(During the course my learning Python 3.x is not supported)

**Components overview**

```
  Inventory
    |
    |
  PlayBook [Consists of play(s)]  ----> Ansible Config ---> Python |------->SSH -------> Target Servers
    ^
    |
  Modules
```

Inventory -> TXT file, that describes your servers & system
[host, host groups, user accounts - which is used to manage the stuff, host related env variables]

Modules -> Programmed unit of work to be done. Its the command centre of the system
[Core modules, extra modules]
[ex: yum modules install some package on the system]

PlayBook -> A single task from a module, executed on a host or a hostgroup
[Glue that brings all together]

Ansible Config -> Global configuration of ansible stays here
[How many parallel exe supposed to run]
[Notify if the target been skipped]
[etc]

**Some variable information**
Three are some variables

1. Host Variables [will be there is Inventory files]
2. Facts - Gathered data from target system before the playbook run, you can use those values to evaluate something, if required !
3. Dynamic Variables - These are the var/values created during the course of playbook run & destroyed after a playbook run

**Process of Execution and Flow**
 - Identify which play/playbooks needs to executed
 - Identify the Target to execute them
 - Establish the SSH & Copy the Play/Play book to the target temp directory
 - Execure the playbook on the target servers
 - Target sends results back to the Control server as a JSON

**Execution Types**
There are TWO execution types
- remote (default): remote execution
- local: local ansible server executing the playbook
[Local execution is pretty typical execution though, since the python package cant be received by default for local server, for that u have to make HTTP/REST call to execute on the local ]


### 2. Creating an Environment

LAB - Setup the 3 vm by using the vagrant (acs,web,db)

**Installing the Ansible**

- On one of CENTOS its epel-release based installation

```bash
$ yum install epel-release
$ yum install ansible -y
```
- Validate by using,

`$ ansible`


**Testing the LAB setup**

Creating an inventory [Ansible relay on this inventory to run any playbook]

`$ mkdir -pv ex-1`

Create a file name called 'inventory' and add the client IP address

```bash
$ vim inventory
  192.168.1.10
  192.168.1.20
```

Run the following command to get reposince as PONG [since we are using ping]

`$ ansible 192.168.1.10 -i ./inventory -u vagrant -m ping -k`


where,
```
 192.168.1.10 - Target server
 -i inventory file location
 -u username
 -m which modules needs to run
 -k prompt for the password
```

- Basically you will get the error msg from SSH for fingerprint related, in order to fix that just do a ssh command to each of server which is in inventory file to add the FINGERPRINT to known_hosts file

How to go in verbose/debug mode - simple add -v at the end of the command

```bash
 $ ansible 192.168.1.10 -i ./inventory -u vagrant -m ping -k -v
 $ ansible 192.168.1.10 -i ./inventory -u vagrant -m ping -k -vv
```

Here is an example of more verbose mode

```bash
$ ansible 192.168.1.10 -i ./inventory -u vagrant -m ping -k -vvv

```

**What happens during the execution**

What actually happens when you run the PING modules against the any targer server (as info retrieved from the above -vvv option)
 - creates the ssh session by using the user/pass info
 - Then starts compiling the python module 'ping' [just compiles the package to make it executables]
    - making directory (space) for the executrion
    - then insode the making everything as "Executables"
    - then ECHO backs the DIR path to ansible, now ansible knows where the stuff needs tp be copied
    - now it puts the complied modules that already (/tmp/tmpvdp3jC) created into that NEW directory that created above
    - as last step by using the PYTHON it gonna execute that ping module
    - and removes the modules after the execution

**How to run the ad-hoc commands**
[by using the command modules]

`$ ansible 192.168.1.10 -i inventory -u centos -m command -a "uptime" -k`

Acutally you NO need to use the `-m command` to specify module because its default, so you can use as follows too

`$ ansible 192.168.1.10 -i inventory -u centos -a "uptime" -k`

- Well there is another module call `Shell`, where you can execute the shell commands.
- So, what is the difference in command & shell modules ?
  Shell module support ENVIRONMENT vairables (HOME,USER,PWD & others) where `command` moduls doesn't support.

### 3 Ansible Inventory and Configuration

**Inventory fundamentals**
- Basically inventory file can be at anywhere in the files system
- What are things can be done on the inventory files
  - Create an required parameter with values
  - Create Groups
  - Grouping the Groups
  - Assign variables
  - Scaling out of multiple files
  - Creating static/dynamic information

**Sample inventory files**

**Sample 1**

```
[db]  # its a groupname
server1.ex.com ansible_ssh_user=dummy ansible_ssh_pass=123 # ansible related var/val
server2.ex.com ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python

[datacenter-west:children]   # here dc-west has the 'db' group as child group (means all nodes under db group are target)
db

[datacenter-west]   # here dc-west has the 'db' as NODE (actual target not a GROUP)
db

[datacenter-west:vars]   # here dc-west has the group specific var/values
ansible_ssh_user=testuser
ansible_ssh_pass=khjhj%^$%
```

**Sample 2**

```
exp-elastic501z ansible_ssh_host=192.168.1.209
exp-elastic502z ansible_ssh_host=192.168.1.4
exp-rundeck501z ansible_ssh_host=192.168.1.37
exp-kibana401z ansible_ssh_host=192.168.1.216
exp-elastic601z ansible_ssh_host=192.168.1.169
exp-kibana101z ansible_ssh_host=192.168.1.236
exp-jslave402z ansible_ssh_host=192.168.1.113
exp-jslave401z ansible_ssh_host=192.168.1.115
exp-jmaster401z ansible_ssh_host=192.168.1.116

[efk]
exp-elastic501z
exp-elastic502z
exp-kibana401z
exp-kibana101z

[cicd]
exp-rundeck501z
exp-jmaster401z
exp-jslave401z
exp-jslave402z

[exp:children]
efk
cicd

[exp:vars]
ansible_ssh_user=centos
ansible_ssh_passwd=redhat or [ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa]
```

**Scaling out with multiple files**

- Basic directory structure
  - Means that, taking about managing multiple inventory files by ansible which gives more clarity. also which has the directory structure
  - Ansible can merge separate inventory files into 1 file (if you want)

- Variable and values precedence
  - That how variables can be applied while executing any tasks on ansibe

```  
    > All (Group_vars)
    >> GroupName (Group_vars)
    >>> HostName (Host_Vars)
```
  - From the above we can see host specific variables will override anything which is specified in the group & all

**Demo Scaling out with multiple files**

- Here we are going to demo 'How variable precedence flows based on ENV directory files'
- Except the inventory file, all files are used for declaring the variables

Info:
  My directory structure
  Files which are listed here are YAML files [So remember the YAML syntax]

```
├── exp
│   ├── group_vars   # All group related VAR goes here
│   │   ├── all
│   │   └── efk      # Specific group relate VAR goes here
│   ├── host_vars
│   │   └── some_server_name_from_efk     # Host specific VAR goes here
│   └── inventory_exp
└── test
    ├── group_vars
    │   ├── all
    │   └── efk
    ├── host_vars
    │   └── some_server_name_from_efk
    └── inventory_test
```

- `inventory_exp` is the same file from ex-2 inventory file
- Now, we are going to add some user on the target server by using the 'all' file to define the var/values

  `$ vi exp/group_vars/all`

  Above file content goes like below

  ```
  ---
  # This is our test username
  username: testuser
  ```

`$ ansible efk -i exp/inventory_exp -m user -a "name={{username}} password=12345"`

where,

"-a" to pass the ARG values to the module "user", about the parenthesis declaration will se in PLAYBOOK creation

- Watch the error regarding the cicd files since its not YAML you might get the error regarding this
- Also there is chance of failing due to permission, so supply the "--sudo" with it.

`$ ansible efk -i "exp/inventory_exp" -m user -a "name={{username}} passwd=12345" --sudo`

- Now create the "exp/group_vars/efk" file with same content different userame & run the above command.
- This is time it will create the USERNAME which is specified the "group_vars" file

`$ ansible efk -i "exp/inventory_exp" -m user -a "name={{username}} passwd=12345" --sudo`

- Now create the "exp/host_vars/some_server_name_from_efk" with same content but with DIFFERENT username & run the same command as above
- This is time it will create the USERNAME which is mentioned in the HOST specific var file

`$ ansible efk -i "exp/inventory_exp" -m user -a "name={{username}} passwd=12345" --sudo`

- So this how precedence follows, simply it goes has follows
  ```
    Host Precedence
    |
    |_ Group Precendence
        |
        |_ All precedence
  ```

**Ansible Configuration basics**

- This how Ansible will load the configuration file location  [Anyone if them, at time not ALL]

```
 1st ~> $ANSIBLE_CONFIG [variable]
 2nd ~> ./config.cfg [From the $PWD]
 3rd ~> ~/.config [from $HOME as hidden file]
 4th ~> /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg [A global config file] - used at LAST
```

- IMPORTANT - Configuration files are NOT merged, FIRST on always wins [which ever it finds]
- But you can onverride the configuration settings by ENV variables

```
ex:
  $ANSIBLE_<sometthing>=123
  [or]
  export ANSIBLE_<something>=123
  [or]
  Update the things in bashrc/profile files to load as soon as you login
```
- Some of the setting for [under [default] section]
 - **fork** [how many execution at the time, default is 5, you can make your own number here]
 - **host_key_cehcking** [highly recommended on PROD]
 - **logging** [writes info above exec, default it NULL, you can set any files location to log the info]

**Demo on above theory**

- Here you can find the all options that available `http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_configuration.html`

- EX-1
 - delete the content ~/.ssh/known_host
 - create the ansible.cfg file (inside/outside of the exp dir)
 - Append the following conetent

```
[defaults]
host_key_checking=False
```
 - now if you run any ansible command to check the HOST related it will work
 - Also it appends the TARGET fingerprint in to the ~/.ssh/known_host too in background silently

- EX-2

 - export the following to check the failure case above scenarion
  `$ export $ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=True`
 - Run any ansible command against the Target servers it will fail now !
 - Because the precedence goes to ENV variables over CFG files

**Working with Python 3 based systems**

 - its pretty simple , install python 2.x version on the target system & update the HOST parameter to pick up the same
```
$ vim invetory
10.0.0.0 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python2.7
```

***Note:*** Above talks with base system that which you run ansible commands. There are support to Python3 ont the both the end. Yet to chaeck the Docs page.

### 5. Modules

Modules are Building block of you Automation

**Fundamentals**

- It does every single action on the target system for you

**3 types of modules**
- Core [from Ansible]
- Extra [from Community]
- Deprecated [Old one]

You no need to all the time to internet to browse the information about modules,

```bash
$ ansible-doc -l
  - list all modules from Ansible

$ ansible-doc <modulesname>
  - more info about the module

$ ansible-doc -s <name>
  - playbook snippet examples
```

- Ansible has 15 Categeries of playbook it supports as of now (server, config mngmt, n/w device mangment, deploy, cicd & many)

Some of the modules, 

  - copy [local to remote]
  - fetch [remote to local]
  - apt/yum/deb for update
  - service module [start/stop service]

**Demo - Web/DB/iptable configuration**
```bash
$ ansible-doc -l
$ ansible-doc yum [all yum related params and args]
```

- Installing the package using yum module

`ansible cfgmng -i exp/inventory_exp -m yum -a "name=vim state=present" --sudo`


Ex: `$ ansible webservers -i exp/inventory_exp -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present" --sudo`

Above command installs the httpd server if its not installed

- Before starting the service, let have look at "service" module
 
```bash
$ ansible-doc service
$ ansible webservers -i exp/inventory_exp -m service -a "name=httpd enabled=yes state=started" --sudo
``

- Install DB

```bash 
$ ansible dbservers -i exp/inventory_exp -m yum -a "name=mysql-server state=present" --sudo
$ ansible dbservers -i exp/inventory_exp -m service -a "name=mysqld state=started" --sudo
```

- Stopping the Iptables
`$ ansible webservers:dbservers -i exp/inventory_exp -m service -a "name=iptables state=stopped" --sudo`

***Note:*** what's up with `webservers:dbservers` pattern

Target Pattern

```
-OR (both the group)
  webservers:dbservers

-NOT (except dbservers)
  !:dbservers

-Wildcard
  web*.ex.com

-Regex
  (~web[0-9]+)

-AND (pretty complex not technically)
  (group1:&group2) - Here we are talking with server which are in both group NOT all node in the both group
  Make sense when you have server with ROLE as WEB & also in PROD

-Complex one
  webservers:&prod:!python3
  - webserver which are in PROD environment but NOT having python 3
```

**Demo using setup modules**

- Setup modules are called `FACT` modules, which brings the all information about the Operating System

`$ ansible cfgmng -i exp/inventory_exp -m setup`
  which retrieves the ultimate information about the system [like ohai in chef]

`$ ansible cfgmng -i exp/inventory_exp -m setup -a "filter=ansible_eth*"`
  which only returns the informataion about the Network interfaces

`$ ansible cfgmng -i exp/inventory_exp -m setup -a "filter=ansible_mount"`
  which gives the information about HDD & other mounts

`$ ansible all -i exp/inventory_exp -m setup --tree ./setup`
  all node information will dumped under setup directory
